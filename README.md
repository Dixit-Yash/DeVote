Traditional voting systems are often plagued by various challenges, including
concerns related to security, transparency, and accessibility. Paper-based voting
methods are susceptible to errors, fraud, and manipulation, while electronic
voting systems face cybersecurity risks and lack transparency in the tallying
process. Additionally, voter turnout and engagement are hindered by logistical
barriers, such as long queues and limited polling locations.

To address these challenges and enhance the integrity of democratic processes,
there is a pressing need for a secure and transparent blockchain-based voting
system. Such a system would leverage the inherent features of blockchain
technology, including immutability, decentralization, and cryptographic security,
to ensure the integrity and transparency of the voting process.
